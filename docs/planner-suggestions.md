# Suggestions: How the Revision Planner Can Push Students to Do More Study on Seneca

These suggestions are grounded in the survey data from 1,305 students (January 2026) and the barriers, behaviours, and preferences identified in the analysis.

## 1. Solve the "What do I study?" paralysis with an opinionated default plan

**The problem:** 17% of independent studiers open Seneca with no plan at all; another 26% rely on Seneca to help them decide. That's 43% of revisers arriving without clear intent. When the planner presents options without a strong recommendation, these students will close the tab.

**The suggestion:** The planner should generate a ready-to-go session by default, not a menu. The current prototype's "Dan's Geography plan" approach is correct, but it should load *started* — the first topic pre-selected, the "Get started" button replaced with "Continue where you left off" for returning users. The goal is to reduce the decision gap between opening Seneca and studying to zero.

**What this changes:** Converts the 17% "don't know — just open Seneca" segment from passive browsers into active studiers by removing the decision point entirely.

## 2. Set a daily minutes target with a visible streak — and make the default higher than students expect

**The problem:** The current prototype uses a 20-minute session as its default plan length. The survey shows students gravitate toward doing the minimum. If the planner says 20 minutes, students will treat that as the ceiling, not the floor.

**The suggestion:** Default the daily target to 30 minutes and frame it as "what top students in your year group do." Show a visible streak counter (consecutive days hitting the target) on the homepage. Let students adjust the target downward if they want — but make the anchoring point aspirational rather than comfortable. The streak mechanic is already validated: 36% of students cite gamification features (memes, leaderboards, rewards) as their favourite thing about Seneca.

**Supporting evidence:**
- Gamification is the #1 liked feature category (75 mentions, 36%)
- "The leaderboard makes me feel competitive and motivates me more" — Year 10
- Spaced repetition is already used by 48% of independent studiers; streaks reinforce the daily habit it requires

## 3. Add a "Next subject" prompt that chains sessions across subjects

**The problem:** The current planner prototype is single-subject (Geography). Students who finish a session see a "Well done!" screen with options to take a break, play a game, or start Biology. But that third option is treated as equal to taking a break — there's no urgency or nudge behind it.

**The suggestion:** After completing a subject session, surface a strong cross-subject recommendation: "You've done 20 mins of Geography. Students with your exam timetable usually do 10 mins of Biology next. Start now?" Frame the prompt around social proof (what similar students do) and keep the friction low — one tap to begin, pre-loaded plan, no decisions required. The session should be shorter than the first to make it feel easy.

**Why this works:** Students are already building study portfolios across tools (one Year 11 described a 3-stage pipeline: Seneca for content, Anki for drilling, exam practice separately). The planner can capture more of that time by making Seneca the place where multi-subject revision happens in one sitting, rather than students switching to Cognito or YouTube for their next subject.

## 4. Surface "wrong answers" more aggressively — front-load them in every session

**The problem:** The current prototype puts "Wrong answers recap" as the third group in the plan, after spaced repetition and new topics. But wrong-answer drilling is the highest-yield activity for exam performance and the survey shows students already value active recall above everything else (61% satisfaction).

**The suggestion:** Move wrong answers to the top of every session. Rename it from "Wrong answers recap" to something less punitive — "Questions you nearly got" or "Quick wins" — to reduce the aversion some students feel toward being reminded of mistakes. Make it the first 3-5 minutes of every session so students are always confronting their weakest knowledge first, when their attention is highest.

**Supporting evidence:**
- Active recall is cited as the #2 liked feature (61% satisfaction)
- Students who use "wrong answer mode" (14%) are the most engaged segment
- "It doesnt help cause i can just cheat my way through" — the planner can fix this by removing notes visibility during wrong-answer sessions

## 5. Use exam countdowns to create urgency — and escalate the daily target as exams approach

**The problem:** Students who use Seneca primarily for homework (39% of the surveyed population) have no reason to open the platform when nothing is assigned. The empty homepage currently shows nothing actionable.

**The suggestion:** If a student has GCSE, A-level, or end-of-year exams coming up, the planner should show a visible countdown ("78 days until Biology Paper 1") and tie the daily plan to it: "To cover your remaining Biology topics before Paper 1, you need ~15 mins/day starting now." As the exam gets closer, the planner should increase the recommended daily time and shift the session mix toward more recap and fewer new topics. The countdown creates urgency that homework deadlines currently provide — but for independent study.

**Supporting evidence:**
- 21% of students say they only use Seneca for homework — this gives them a reason beyond homework
- "I don't revise that much and when I do Seneca doesn't come to mind" — Year 9. Countdowns make the need visible.
- Year 11 (GCSE year) is the largest segment in the survey (404 students). Exam urgency is already on their minds — the planner should reflect it.

## 6. Introduce "study pacts" — social commitments with classmates

**The problem:** Students describe studying as a solitary, boring activity. The leaderboard is the only social feature cited, and while it works for motivation, it doesn't create accountability for actually showing up.

**The suggestion:** Let students form study pacts with 2-4 classmates: "All of us will hit 30 mins on Seneca today." If everyone in the pact completes their target, all members get a bonus XP multiplier. If someone misses a day, the pact streak resets. This converts the existing competitive instinct (leaderboards) into collaborative accountability. The peer pressure to not let the group down is a more powerful motivator than individual streaks for most teenagers.

**Supporting evidence:**
- Leaderboard/competitive features are already the top motivator
- "The memes on it are really enticing and the leaderboard makes me feel competitive" — Year 10
- Students are social by nature; giving them a way to study "together" on Seneca keeps them on the platform rather than switching to group study on Discord with YouTube videos

## 7. Add a "Catch up" mode for students who've fallen behind

**The problem:** Students who miss a few days of independent study face an accumulating backlog. The planner shows them what they should have done, which feels overwhelming. These are the "lazy" students the survey shows are actually overwhelmed, not disengaged — they don't know where to start when they're behind.

**The suggestion:** When a student hasn't used Seneca for 3+ days, replace the normal planner with a "Catch up" mode: a shorter, focused session (10-15 minutes) that prioritises only the most critical weak areas. Frame it as "Let's get back on track — just 10 minutes today." The goal is to lower the re-entry barrier dramatically. Once they complete one catch-up session, transition them back to the normal planner with a slightly reduced daily target that ramps back up over a week.

**Supporting evidence:**
- "'Lazy' students are actually overwhelmed, not disengaged" — Finding #3 in the survey
- "I am just kinda lazy. But if I do have a test/exam I definitely would revise" — Year 7
- Students who feel behind often abandon the platform entirely. A gentle re-entry path prevents permanent churn.

## 8. Make the planner visible from the homepage — even when homework is assigned

**The problem:** The current Seneca experience prioritises homework above everything else. Students in the "Only homework" and "Mostly homework" segments (39% combined) never scroll past the homework section, so they never discover that independent revision exists. The planner only matters if students see it.

**The suggestion:** Place the revision planner card directly below the homework section on the homepage, with a clear message: "Done with homework? Here's your revision plan for today — 25 mins." It should be visible, not hidden behind a tab or a secondary navigation item. The current prototype's "Planner / For you" toggle is good for the subject page, but the first touchpoint must be the homepage itself.

**Supporting evidence:**
- "Seneca is usually empty... theres just nothing to do. Theres no recommendations." — Year 10
- Priority #1 in the survey analysis: "Fix the empty state / homepage"
- 15% of "Only homework" students cite navigation as a barrier — they literally can't find revision content

## 9. Reward volume, not just completion — XP scaling for longer sessions

**The problem:** The current XP system rewards completing a topic, which incentivises doing the minimum number of topics. A student who does 20 minutes gets roughly the same XP-per-minute as a student who does 60 minutes.

**The suggestion:** Introduce XP scaling that rewards sustained sessions: the first 15 minutes earn 1x XP, minutes 15-30 earn 1.5x, and minutes 30-60 earn 2x. Show the multiplier visibly in the planner ("You're earning 2x XP right now!"). This creates a direct incentive to extend sessions beyond the plan. Cap it at 60 minutes to discourage unhealthy cramming, but make the 30-60 minute window significantly more rewarding than stopping at 20.

**Supporting evidence:**
- Gamification is the #1 liked feature; XP already matters to students
- "Continue gamification and rewarding efforts" is Priority #9 in the survey — low-cost, high-retention
- This addresses the "boring" perception by making longer sessions feel like a game with escalating rewards

## 10. Send push notifications tied to the planner — not generic reminders

**The problem:** Generic "Time to revise!" notifications are easy to ignore. They don't tell the student what to do or why it matters right now.

**The suggestion:** Tie notifications to specific planner state: "You have 11 wrong answers in Biology waiting — 4 mins to clear them" or "Your Geography streak is at 12 days — don't break it now." The notification should contain the exact action and the exact time commitment, so the student can make an instant decision. Use the exam countdown for urgency near exam season: "54 days until Chemistry Paper 1. Today's plan: 25 mins."

**Supporting evidence:**
- Students cite "forgetting Seneca exists" as a core barrier when no homework is set
- The planner has all the data needed to personalise these messages (weak areas, streaks, exam dates)
- Specific, actionable notifications outperform generic ones — this is established UX research
